# PythonProjects
My display of neat and orderly Python Programming

Projects:
<p>M02_Lab.py = Getting user input for 6 different items and calculating the sales tax, subtotal, and average price of these items. All results are displayed back to the user.</p>
<p>M03_Lab.py = Calculates shipping cost at a flat rate per poundage to the user, after entering how much their package weighs!</p>
<p>M04_Lab.py = Calculating organism spawn rates on a daily basis by getting user input for starting organisms, spawn rate/day, and the total days the experiment is going on.</p>
<p>M05_Lab.py = Calculating total price of a Coliseum's seating between four different classes. Each section of seating has a set price and the user inputs the total seats in each section. The output will show total price for each section as well as a total purchase of the entire Coliseum together.</p>
<p>M06_Lab.py = Reads numbers from of a seperate text file within the directory and averages out the total numbers. This also starts the introduction of exception handling on top of input validation.</p>
<p>M09_Lab.py = Allows a user to enter any NFL team that has won the superbowl. This then scans an external file(superbowlwinners.txt = every time that has won the NFL Superbowl) into a list and finds how many times the user's team has won the NFL Superbowl.</p>
<p>M10_Lab.py = Program that reads any external txt document to scan for the amount of words and sentences within that document. The program then counts the average words per line (paragraph) and displays back to the user.</p>
<p>M11_Lab.py = Assigns values manually to different students, storing that information in an external classes program (stu.py) and displaying that information back to the user.</p>
<p>M12_Lab.py = Program that allows a user to enter in Student information (first/last name, address, phone number, student ID, total credits for the current term, and finally the students enrollment status for the next semester). This holds all information in an external class program (classes.py) and displays the information back to the user. The best part about this program is, is that you can keep this classes.py program and use this to build different, newer, or better programs using the same base class program.</p>
